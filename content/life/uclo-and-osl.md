I've started working as a technician at University College London Observatory and in the Optical Science Lab (where I did my PhD, also in UCL).

It's pretty varied and interesting. We're assembling the corrector optics for DESI at the moment in OSL. This is a big job; there are 6 lenses which are each about 1m in diameter, all of which have to be aligned accurately to within ~10 microns. There is a lot of fiddly manual work involved in this, as well as a lot of thought about measurements, sources of error and co-ordinate systems. 

In the observatory I am partly responsible for looking after the site as a whole, so I've done a lot of general work like fixing lights and working with contractors, but also some technical stuff when the various telescopes inevitably stop working or need new features. The Radcliffe in particular is showing it's age and needs an update/overhaul in the near future. It is a relatively complex system controlled entirely by 80s-era electronics on massive cards in a wardrobe-sized control box. Although it is quite unique in it's age and ability to acquire targets automatically, I suspect it is not the only telescope which suffers from problems due to outdated technology and lack of funds for maintenance.  

Working with this has been an interesting lesson on longevity and obsolescence. How can you design something to work for 10+ years when you have no idea what kind of protocols and technology will even exist so far ahead? Will we still have USB? Ethernet? It is impressive that the control system still works at all in my opinion.

It was designed to be modular and upgradable, but paradigm shifts within automation and control across the 20+ years since it was built mean that this has become difficult despite the best efforts of the designer (Dr Peter Thomas, who wrote his thesis on automating the Radcliffe in the early 90s, did an excellent job). For instance, even replacing a stepper motor driver becomes an ordeal. Computation was expensive back in the 90s, so it was pretty normal to send a full-speed step sequence to a driver and have it physically buffer and slow down the sequence to provide an acceleration profile. I had never heard of this before, because it is so easy now to compute the acceleration (and everything else) centrally...  Anyway, the Radcliffe probably deserves it's own post sometime in the future. 

I also got an allotment just next to the observatory, and have been enjoying gardening despite being entirely new to it. I have a big plot (10 poles!) but inherited several fruit trees and left a decent amount unplanted, so it hasn't been overwhelming. I often go there at lunchtime with some soup and do a bit of weeding.
