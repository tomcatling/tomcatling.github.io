Continuing the trend (but hopefully signalling the end) of large delays between updates, I thought I should post something. A lot has happened recently: I have a job and I'm moving off the boat. This is a little bit sad as it means the end of a lot of freedom, but I am also excited about both things because of stuff that I have been missing, such as a healthy work/life balance and hot water on demand. My friend took this photo and sent it to me, but I don't want to upload it to Facebook and tag myself in it, so I will post it here instead because I think it is a nice picture that commemorates my boat-PhD life of the last year.

Unfortunately Triangle will have to go and live in Sheffield for a while, but we will be reunited eventually.
